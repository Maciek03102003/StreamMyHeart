# OBS Plugin: PulseOBS - Webcam Based Heart Rate Monitoring for Live Streamers
PulseOBS is a plugin that measures your heart rate directly using your webcam and facial detection. It supports both macOS and Windows.

## Introduction

PulseOBS is designed to help live streamers monitor their heart rate without the need for wearable devices. Currently, it supports heart rate measurement for a single person visible in the webcam feed.

> **Note:** This plugin should not be used for medical purposes and does not provide any medical advice.

> **Warning:** This plugin consumes significant CPU resources.

### OBS Version Support and Compatibility
PulseOBS supports the latest OBS version 31.0.1.

## Quick Start

1. Add a `Video Capture Device` as a source in OBS Studio.

2. Select `Video Capture Device` and click `Filters`.

3. Under `Effect Filters`, select `Heart Rate Monitor`.

4. Click `Heart Rate Monitor` to configure settings.

5. The heart rate can be displayed as a text source or a graph source.

## Suggested Setting Combination

## Technical Details

### Heart Rate Calculation
PulseOBS provides multiple algorithms to calculate heart rate:

### Filtering
Pre and Post Filtering methods are used to improve accuracy:

Pre-Filtering:
- Bandpass
- Detrending
- Zero Mean

Post-Filtering:
- Bandpass

### Face Detection and Tracking
PulseOBS uses face detection and tracking to optimize processing speed and improve accuracy. Available face detection methods:

- Basic Algorithm
    - Uses OpenCV Haar Cascade

- Advanced Algorithm
    - Uses dlib HoG (with and without face tracking)
    - Face detection is performed every 60 frames.
    - Face tracking is used between detections to enhance performance.

## Evaluation
All PPG, filtering and face detection combinations were tested on the UBFC2 dataset [2], comparing to the ground truth and values generated by the python library pyVHR [1], a library for studying methods of pulse rate estimation from videos. Our PCA algorithm achieved consistently better performance, with and without filtering, compared to the implementation in pyVHR, which can be seen here:
